# HerbiHocusFocus

I built this old app when someone asked for custom highlighting of keyboard focus in Windows. It works in some places. I also used it to discuss considerations around building accessible apps. Here's an old article related to the app, [Considerations around the accessibility of a WinForms Store app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/winuiautomation/considerations-around-the-accessibility-of-a-winforms-store-app). The pictures seem to have disappeared from the article, and some of my other articles which are referenced by this article have also apparently been taken down. That's entropy for you.

Here are a couple of videos of the app:
